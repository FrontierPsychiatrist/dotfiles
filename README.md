# My public dotfiles

These are my dotfiles to use on my UNIX machines.

They can be managed with [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). The best way
to do that is to clone this repository into `~/.dotfiles`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FrontierPsychiatrist/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow emacs
```

This will create symlinks for emacs config files in the home directory.
